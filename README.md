# TooManyLoras
A very simple ComfyUI node that allows you to use up to 10 Loras.

### Installation
Just drop the file `TooManyLoras.py` inside the folder `custom_nodes` in your ComfyUI installation path.

`C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Data\Packages\ComfyUI\custom_nodes`

And that's it, just restart your ComfyUI and you should find the node by typing *"TooManyLoras"*

### How does it work?
It works exactly like a normal Lora Loader node, except that it can Load up to 10 Loras at once.
Each Lora weight can be tweaked individually.
You just need to plug-in your `model` checkpoint and `clip` as normal.

I made this node for myself but I thought It'd be nice to share with the community.


I hope someone finds good use of it!

Enjoy ðŸ¤—
